            <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Umair Shafiq, a passionate individual with a keen interest in both development and
                football. By day, I delve into the world of development, seeking innovative solutions and ways to make a
                positive impact. When the workday is done, you'll often find me on the football pitch, chasing after
                that elusive goal or enjoying the camaraderie of teammates.</p>
            <p>My dedication to development extends beyond just software or infrastructure; I'm also committed to
                personal growth and community betterment. Whether it's through coding, volunteering, or simply lending a
                helping hand, I strive to contribute meaningfully to the world around me.</p>
            <p>On the football field, I find joy in the beautiful game's blend of strategy, athleticism, and teamwork.
                It's not just about scoring goals but also about the shared experiences, the lessons learned through
                wins and losses, and the friendships forged along the way.</p>
            <p>With a drive for progress in both my professional and personal pursuits, I aim to continuously learn,
                grow, and make a difference, both on and off the field.</p>

    <section id="Hobbies">
        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <h3>1. Football (Soccer or American)</h3>
        <p>Football is a central passion. Whether playing in a local league, practicing skills at the park, or watching
            favorite teams on TV, this hobby provides excitement and physical activity. Engaging in fantasy football
            leagues and collecting memorabilia adds a
            layer of involvement and connection to the sport.</p>
        <h3>2. Technology and Coding</h3>
        <p>As a Computer Science major, there is a natural inclination towards technology and coding. This involves
            working on personal or collaborative programming projects, participating in hackathons, and contributing to
            open-source communities. Exploring new programming
            languages, developing apps, and tinkering with hardware are key aspects of this hobby.</p>
        <h3>3. Gaming</h3>
        <p>Gaming is a popular pastime, offering both relaxation and a challenge. This includes playing video games on
            various platforms (console, PC, mobile), engaging in esports and competitive gaming, and enjoying board
            games and tabletop RPGs with friends. Gaming serves as both a
            social activity and a way to unwind after a day of coding or studying.</p>
        <h3>4. Fitness and Sports</h3>
        <p>Staying active is important, and aside from football, there is an interest in other sports such as
            basketball and tennis. Regular workouts at the gym, jogging, or participating in outdoor activities like
            hiking or biking help maintain physical fitness and provide a break from screen time.</p>
        <h3>5. Entertainment</h3>
        <p>Entertainment plays a significant role in leisure time. Watching movies and TV shows on streaming platforms
            like Netflix and YouTube offers a way to relax and enjoy stories from various genres. Additionally,
            listening to podcasts and music provides entertainment on the go, whether commuting or taking a break from
            studies. Streaming platforms and
            social media keep them connected with the latest in entertainment and tech trends.</p>
